# Blood Connect - Blood Donation Management Web Application

Blood Connect is a web application developed as the final project of the 5Âª .NET Academy at Atos/UFN using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework, designed to facilitate the connection between blood banks and blood donors.

## Overview
Blood Connect aims to streamline the process of finding suitable blood donors for blood banks. By registering as a donor on the web application, authenticated blood banks can easily view these donors and use the filter to find potential blood donors.

## Key Features
- User Registration: Donors and Blood Banks can register on the Web Application and provide their personal information, including blood type (for donors), address and contact details.
- Donor Search: Blood banks have access to search for registered donors based on specific criteria using the filter.
- CRUD Operations by admin user.
- Authentication and Authorization: The application utilizes the Identity Framework for user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access tu user functionalities.

## Next Steps
- Implement a new feature to send emails to registered donors and respond to received contacts using the SMTP protocol.

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core MVC: The web application framework for building the user interface and handling HTTP requests.
- Entity Framework: The object-relational mapping (ORM) framework used for data access and database management.
- SQL Server: The relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage donor and blood bank information.
- Identity Framework: The authentication and authorization framework used to manage user accounts and access control.
- Bootstrap: The framework used for styling web pages.
